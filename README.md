# Caesar-cipher
With this app you can easily write encoded messages, as well as to decode them.  
"In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence" (Wiki).

Instructions:
1. Type encode to make your message secret, or decode to reveal a message that you have received
2. Type your message or paste the received message
3. Select the amount of shift that you want to use to encode/decode your message
4. Copy and send your encoded message / or read your decoded message

In this project I learned:
- How to create functions
- How to make a program repeatable through while loops
